## Usage

Simply install Livebook then you can click the **Run in Livebook** badge above to load the file.

Ensure you set `OPENAI_TOKEN` in your secret store on the left sidebar to use the OpenAI adapter.

You can switch this out for any other adapter of your choosing as long as it's supported by [Instructor](https://github.com/thmsmlr/instructor_ex).

You will also need to make sure you have the `ffmpeg` binary installed in `PATH` and visible to the Livebook
environment.
